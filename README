features:

 * zero downtime code hot-swapping
   - TODO: abort deploy
   - TODO: ctrl+C auto abort deploy
 * ability to change environment variables of workers with zero downtime
   - TODO
 * resuscitation - when a worker dies it is restarted
   - TODO
 * redirect worker stdout and stderr to rotating log files
   - TODO
 * runs as daemon, providing ability to start and stop
   - TODO: when stopping, first try 'shutdown', timeout to sigterm, timeout to sigkill
   - TODO: status actually checks whether the process is running

usage:

    To use naught, your node.js server has 2 requirements.
    
    1. Once the server is fully booted and is readily accepting connections,

       process.send('online');

    2. Listen to the 'shutdown' message and shutdown gracefully. This message
       is emitted after there is already a newer instance of your server
       online and taking care of business:

       process.on('message', function(message) {
           if (message === 'shutdown') {
               performCleanup();
               process.exit(0);
           }
       }


CLI:

    naught start [options] server.js [script-options]

        Starts server.js as a daemon passing script-options as command
        line arguments.

        Available options and their defaults:

        --worker-count 1
        --pidfile naught.pid
        --log naught.log
        --stdout stdout.log
        --stderr stderr.log
        --max-log-size 10485760
        --cwd .


    naught stop [options] [pidfile.pid]

        Stops the running server which created the pidfile.
        Uses `naught.pid` by default.

        This sends SIGTERM to the process and waits for timeout, then
        sends SIGKILL if the process has not already exited.

        Available options and their defaults:

            --timeout 5


    naught deploy [options] [pidfile.pid]

        Replaces workers with new workers using new code and optionally
        the environment variables from this command. Naught does this one
        worker at a time, and waits to kill a worker until after the
        replacement is online.
        Uses `naught.pid` by default.

        Available options and their defaults:

            --replace-env true


    naught deploy-abort [pidfile.pid]

        Aborts a hanging deploy. A hanging deploy happens when a new worker
        fails to emit the 'online' message, or when an old worker fails
        to shutdown upon receiving the 'shutdown' message.

        Uses `naught.pid` by default.
